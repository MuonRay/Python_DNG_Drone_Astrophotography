# Python_DNG_Drone_Astrophotography
A series of basic image processing codes that employ a simple image exposure stacking procedure on DNG (RAW) files taken using DJI Drones for use in Astrophotography. The codes convert all the DNGs to JPEGS in the source directory for observation. Images are typically taken using an ISO of 12800, an aperture size of 2.8 with varying shutter speed times (although with my modified Hasselblad multispectral camera I find the best results below 4s exposure time). The codes available can do summed pixel stacking, clipped pixel stacking, brightness enhanced exposure stacking and pixel averaging image stacking. These codes are experimental and are developed for comparison with the Sequator Free Astrophotography Software, with the output jpeg images usable in this software.
